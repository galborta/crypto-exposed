                    Crypto Exposed serves as a vital repository documenting individuals who have compromised the integrity 
                    of our industry through actions that contradict our core values. In an era where transparency is paramount, 
                    we provide a permanent record of offenses against true cypherpunk ethos.
                </p>
                
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Our platform exists to shine a light on those who have betrayed the trust of the cryptocurrency community. 
                    We believe that accountability and transparency are essential for the healthy development of our industry, 
                    and that documenting these transgressions serves as both a warning and a reminder of our collective 
                    responsibility.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    This is more than just a database - it's a public testament to our commitment to upholding the values 
                    that cryptocurrency was built upon: transparency, accountability, and trust. Here, these records are 
                    inscribed for perpetuity, ensuring that these actions are never forgotten and serving as a deterrent 
                    for future misconduct.
